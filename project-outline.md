# Elementary English Learning Web App - Project Outline

## Project Overview
An interactive web application designed for 4th-6th grade students to help them understand English reading comprehension questions and improve their English skills.

## Target Users
- Elementary students (grades 4-6)
- Primary pain point: Unable to understand English test questions
- Secondary needs: Building vocabulary and comprehension skills

## Core Features

### 1. Question Helper (Priority 1)
- Display English reading passages and questions
- Provide instant word translations on hover/click
- Break down complex sentences into simpler parts
- Explain question types and what they're asking for
- Visual aids (icons, images) to support understanding

### 2. Interactive Practice (Priority 2)
- Multiple choice questions with immediate feedback
- Highlight key words in questions
- Step-by-step hints system
- Progress tracking for each session

### 3. Vocabulary Builder (Priority 3)
- Common words for this age group
- Visual flashcards
- Simple example sentences
- Audio pronunciation (optional)

## Technical Stack Suggestions
Please recommend appropriate technologies considering:
- Should work on school computers (browser-based)
- No complex setup required
- Responsive design (works on tablets)
- Possibility to add backend later for progress tracking

## UI/UX Requirements
- Large, readable fonts
- Colorful but not distracting
- Simple navigation (max 3 clicks to any feature)
- Encouraging feedback (positive reinforcement)
- Clean, child-friendly design

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Basic question display interface
- Word translation feature
- Simple multiple choice interaction
- Static content (no backend needed)

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Add more question types
- Implement hint system
- Add visual aids and illustrations
- Improve feedback mechanisms

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- User accounts and progress tracking
- Adaptive difficulty
- Teacher dashboard
- Performance analytics

## Content Structure
- Reading passages: 100-200 words
- Questions: 4-6 per passage
- Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Topics: Age-appropriate (animals, school, family, hobbies)

## Success Metrics
- Students can understand questions independently
- Reduced time needed to complete assignments
- Improved test scores
- Positive student feedback

## Constraints
- Must be intuitive (minimal instructions needed)
- Fast loading times
- Works offline (after initial load) if possible
- Accessible (consider students with learning differences)

## Questions for Technical Planning
1. Should we use a frontend framework (React/Vue) or vanilla JavaScript?
2. Where should we store practice content (JSON files, database)?
3. How to implement the translation feature (API or local dictionary)?
4. What's the best approach for audio pronunciation?
5. Should we plan for mobile app conversion later?

## Inspiration References
- Duolingo (gamification and feedback style)
- Little Nightmares (atmospheric design - but cheerful for kids)
- Khan Academy Kids (clear explanations)
